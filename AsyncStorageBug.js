This React Native bug arises when using AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data.  The issue manifests when attempting to retrieve data before it has been fully stored, particularly within a component's lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`. This often leads to null or undefined values being returned unexpectedly, causing subsequent operations to fail or render incorrectly.  The problem is exacerbated by asynchronous operations; the retrieval function executes before AsyncStorage has completed writing the data.
